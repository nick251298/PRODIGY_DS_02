# Car Attribute and Insurance Claim Correlation Analysis

This project performs a detailed analysis of car attributes and their relationship with policyholder demographics. By using correlation matrices and heatmaps, the aim is to identify key patterns between car characteristics (such as engine displacement, cylinder count, and dimensions) and factors like population density and policyholder age.

## Key Features:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand how physical car attributes are related to each other.
- **Demographic Insights**: Investigate the relationship between policyholder demographics (age, location) and car characteristics.
- **Data Visualization**: Create heatmaps to visualize correlations between numeric variables.

## Methods:
1. **Data Selection**: The analysis focuses on numeric columns related to car specifications and policyholder details.
2. **Correlation Matrix**: A correlation matrix is computed to identify strong positive and negative relationships between variables.
3. **Heatmaps**: Visual representation of the correlation matrix is done using heatmaps to highlight key patterns.

## Results:
- Larger cars with bigger engines tend to have strong correlations with each other.
- There is a negative relationship between car size and population density, suggesting smaller cars in densely populated areas.
- Policyholder age is positively correlated with the age of their cars, indicating older individuals tend to own older cars.

## Usage:
The project uses Python libraries such as:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
